# Book Identification

This project servers the purpose of allowing easier access to book information. The project will take in book covers, compare them to a small dataset of covers, and return the title and rating the book was given. While this project is limited at the moment, specifically with a small dataset and the project only being able to identify online book covers, it is proof of the limitless possibilities that come with this technology.

## The Algorithm

The project's dataset consists of a variety of book covers. The program uses a python script to sort the original dataset folder into something that can be interepted and trained with. When any image of a book cover is fed into it, the script returns both the title and the avearage rating of the book.
